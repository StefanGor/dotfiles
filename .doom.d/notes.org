#+TITLE: notes

* ivy
ivy-read example usage:
(ivy-read "Your choice:"
          '("apple" "plum" "orange")
          :action (lambda (choice)
                    (message "I chose %s" choice)))

pressing C-SPC while doing ivy search lets you preview
counsel-projectile-find-file-matcher might need to change this to match basename only?
* which key
explicit abort key
:desc "Which key abort" "ESC" #'which-key-abort

* omnisharp
after finding usages, C-o will open in alternate window to <Enter>
omnisharp-solution-errors can be invoked with errors-only = true by going 'SPC u <M-x>' to use universal argument, this is due to (interactive "P")
apparently there is a way to use extra dlls e.g. roslynator, see omnisharp githu b

* evil
g- is used to decrement: (evil-numbers/dec-at-pt), g= to increment

* org
pressing S-TAB enough times will expand all headers

* misc
swiper is cool, SPC / b
undo-propose is a possibly better alternative to undo-tree?
As a side note, the functionality of avy-goto-char, avy-goto-char-2 and avy-goto-line are already available on the gsf, gss, and gsj/gsk keys, respectively. https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/1643
C-M-a C-M-e to move between functions in C mode
